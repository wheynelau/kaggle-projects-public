### [WANDB logs](https://wandb.ai/wheynelau/kaggle-summaries-scoring?workspace=user-wheynelau)

### Winning solutions

Most of the winning solutions used generated data by LLMs for pretraining the model. The model was the same for most of the solutions, which was a deberta model. Suspect my model was not trained on the generated data, which is why it did not perform well.
